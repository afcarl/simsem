# SimSem #

SimSem is a tool for semantic disambiguation using approximate string matching
and is distributed under the restrictions of the
[ISC License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/isc-license.txt).
To accomplish this SimSem uses large collections of strings such as
dictionaries, [LibLinear](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/) as its
machine-learning component and
[SimString](http://www.chokkan.org/software/simstring/index.html.en) for fast
approximate string matching. Please see the publication mentioned below for
details.
