Monoclonal autoantibodies specific for kidney proximal tubular brush border from mice with experimentally induced chronic graft-versus-host disease.
Nine hybridomas producing monoclonal autoantibodies specific for kidney proximal tubular brush border were found in 600 hybridomas derived from (C57BL/6J X DBA/2)F1 mice injected with DBA/2 T cells. None of the 1100 hybridomas derived from nonautoimmune (C57BL/6J X DBA/2)F1 mice produced antibodies with a similar specificity. Four of these nine monoclonal antibodies were characterized further. They did not bind to cryosections of liver, lung, stomach, or intestine. Three bound to kidney proximal tubular brush border of mouse, cattle, sheep, pigs, rabbits, rats, and humans, whereas the fourth was specific only for murine brush border. All four precipitated from mouse kidney microvilli, a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 160,000 under reducing as well as nonreducing conditions. Removal of asparagine-linked carbohydrate with EndoF reduced the molecular weight of the 160,000 protein by about 20,000. One of the three multi-species-specific antibodies bound to pig kidney aminopeptidase, a glycosylated enzyme located on the microvilli of kidney proximal tubular brush border. Three antibodies have a heavy-chain variable region encoded by VH genes of the J558 family, whereas the heavy-chain variable region of the fourth is encoded by a VH gene of the 7183 family. Attempts to passively transfer immune complex glomerulonephritis to normal mice by injection of the purified monoclonal antibodies or by growth of the corresponding hybridoma cells in mice have so far been unsuccessful. However, antibodies recognizing the 160,000 molecule are present in the serum of mice with chronic graft-versus-host disease and can be eluted from kidneys with immune complex glomerulonephritis.
