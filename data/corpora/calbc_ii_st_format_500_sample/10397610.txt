Synergistic effect of formulated plasmid and needle-free injection for genetic vaccines.
PURPOSE: A plasmid-based gene expression system was complexed with protective, interactive, and non-condensing (PINC) polymer system and administered with Medi-Jector, a needle-free injection device (NFID), to achieve high and sustained levels of antigen-specific antibodies in blood circulation. METHODS: Human growth hormone (hGH) or bacterial beta-galactosidase gene expression plasmids driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter were formulated in saline or complexed with a PINC polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and intramuscularly or subcutaneously administered into dogs and pigs using a 22-gauge needle or a NFID. The hGH-specific IgG titers in serum were measured by an ELISA. Beta-galactosidase expression was measured in injected muscles by an enzymatic assay or immunohistochemistry. The effect of NFID on DNA stability and topology was assessed by gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Intramuscular (i.m.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of a hGH expression plasmid pCMV-hGH (0.05-0.5 mg/kg) in dogs and pigs elicited antigen-specific IgG antibody titers to expressed hGH. With both routes of injection, pDNA delivery by a NFID was superior to pDNA injection by needle. The magnitude of hGH-specific IgG titers with NFID was 15-20-fold higher than needle injection when pDNA was complexed with PVP, and only 3-4-fold higher with pDNA in saline. The transfection efficiency in the injected muscle, as measured by beta-galactosidase expression, following i.m. injection of pCMV-betagalactosidase/PVP, was not significantly different between needle and NFID-injected groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the combination of pDNA/ PVP complexes and a NFID act synergistically to achieve high and sustained levels of antigen-specific IgG response to expressed antigen. This gene delivery approach may offer advantage over needle injection of naked DNA for the development of genetic vaccines.
