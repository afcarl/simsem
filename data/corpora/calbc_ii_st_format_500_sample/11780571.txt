Serum levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in patients treated with dental implants.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of proinflammatory interleukins (IL)--IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 in the blood of patients subjected to dental implant anchorage procedures. The study involved 10 generally healthy people aged 27-52, 4 men and 6 women. The patients were characterised by normal oral hygiene and lack of clinical symptoms of oral inflammation. Surgical procedures used Italian Logos system dental implants. The blood for analysis was collected three times: prior to surgery, one day and four months after the procedure before implant exposure. NoneInterleukin levels were assayed with the ELISA method. The results were subjected to statistical analysis using Wicoxon's test. In all the cases examined soft tissue healing following the procedure was uneventful. The three consecutive examinations revealed similar IL-1 blood levels. Mean serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 increased significantly in the second examination and returned to the close-to-initial values after 4 months. Increase of blood serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the first day after implantation reflects local inflammation process caused by tissue impair.
