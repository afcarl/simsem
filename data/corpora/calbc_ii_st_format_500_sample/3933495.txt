Deficiency of a mouse kidney metalloendopeptidase activity: immunological demonstration of an altered gene product.
NoneMeprin, an 85,000 molecular weight metalloendopeptidase is a major component of the kidney brush border membrane in mice. Some inbred mouse strains exhibit low levels of meprin activity. These strains were characterized by little, if any, protein in brush border preparations corresponding to the native enzyme. However, material exhibiting partial identity to meprin was identified by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion. Immunoblots of brush border proteins confirmed that this immunoreactive material was present but of higher molecular weight than the native enzyme. The implication of these data is that the structural gene for meprin is expressed, albeit incorrectly, in the low-meprin strains.
