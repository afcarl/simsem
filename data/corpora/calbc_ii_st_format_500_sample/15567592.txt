Vaccination of mice and sheep with Fh12 FABP from Fasciola hepatica using the new adjuvant/immunomodulator system ADAD.
We evaluate the ability of a Fasciola hepatica FABP native antigen (Fh12) with a new vaccination system called ADAD to protect mice and sheep against an experimental F. hepatica infection. The vaccination protocol consists of a set of two injections. The first injection contains a micelle in which two components are included, saponin from Quillaja saponaria (Qs) and/or Anapsos (A) a Polypodium leucotomos hydroalcoholic extract, both emulsified in a non-mineral oil (Montanide) in a water/oil emulsion (30/70). This is subcutaneously injected to achieve the "adaptation" of the immune system to subsequent stimuli. The second injection contains in addition the Fh12 antigen. Two different experiments were carried out using two mouse strains (BALB/c and CD-1). NoneMice vaccinated with Qs+A+Fh12 presented a survival rate of 40%, when compared with control groups. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficiency of the vaccination in sheep against an experimental F. hepatica challenge. The vaccinated sheep presented lower fluke recovery (24.5%), number of eggs in bile fluid (58.1%) and faeces (40.3%) than control groups. The recovered flukes were shorter (32.7%), immature (34.0%) and with lower body mass (31.6%) than non-complete vaccinated sheep. Thus, the new ADAD system could be a good alternative for future vaccination experiments against fasciolosis.
