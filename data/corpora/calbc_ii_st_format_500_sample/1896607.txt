Cloning and expression of genomic DNA sequences coding for putative erythrocyte membrane-associated antigens of Plasmodium falciparum.
NoneGenomic DNA fragments of Plasmodium falciparum generated by mung bean nuclease digestion were cloned in the lambda expression vector lambda JK2. The resulting library was screened with a rabbit antiserum raised against purified membranes of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and with a serum pool from immune humans from an endemic area of Liberia. Positive clones were rescreened with a series of human and monkey sera. Twelve selected clones were analysed in detail. Four of them corresponded to already described membrane-associated P. falciparum antigens. The other positive clones contained inserts which, according to the nucleotide sequence, Southern blot analysis and immunological characteristics, correspond to so far unknown antigens.
