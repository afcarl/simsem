Diagnostic application of monoclonal antibody KB90 (CD11c) in acute myeloid leukaemia.
The expression of membrane CD11c by leukaemic blast cells was examined (indirect immunorosetting) in 75 cases of acute leukaemia (myeloid, n = 60; lymphoid, n = 15) and evaluated as a potential marker for the diagnostic discrimination between monocytic (AMML-M4 and AMoL-M5) and non-monocytic (M1, M2 and M3) AML subtypes. Preliminary studies of normal bone marrow cells indicated that CD11c expression was not restricted to cells of monocytic lineage but was also present, with apparent lower density, on significant proportions of mature and immature granulocytes. Examination of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) subtypes revealed that the non-monocytic leukaemias (n = 33) were CD11c-, defined as less than 30% positive cells, whereas all but one of the AMML-M4 (n = 13) and AMoL-M5 (n = 14) cases were CD11c+. All 15 cases of lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) showed less than 5% CD11c+ blasts. Membrane CD11c expression was also compared to the more widely used markers of monocytic differentiation; cytoplasmic alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) and membrane CD14 expression. This analysis showed that all 13 AMML-M4 leukaemias studied, including seven cases that were CD14- and eight that were ANAE-, were CD11c+. In addition, the AMoL-M5 cases (all of which were ANAE+) could be phenotypically subdivided into CD11c+ CD14+ (n = 9), CD11c+ CD14- (n = 4) and CD11c- CD14- (n = 1) subgroups. The study also confirmed that the discriminitive ability and sensitivity of the immunorosetting procedure for the detection of membrane CD11c compared favourably to immunofluorescent staining intensities as measured by flow cytometry.
