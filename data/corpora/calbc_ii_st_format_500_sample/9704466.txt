Clinical aspects and typing of platelet alloantigens.
Platelet alloantigens can induce the formation of corresponding alloantibodies when exposed to phenotypically negative individuals. These antibodies are responsible for fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, posttransfusion purpura, passive alloimmune thrombocytopenia and transplantation-associated thrombocytopenia and may contribute to platelet transfusion refractoriness together with HLA antibodies. Besides antibody detection laboratory diagnosis of the clinical syndromes requires alloantigen typing. Furthermore, typed platelet donors are a prerequisite for effective platelet transfusion therapy. Different techniques for phenotyping are well established and easy to perform but they rely on the availability of antisera. Since the molecular genetic background of the clinically most relevant alloantigens has been elucidated during the last years various genotyping methods have been applied to the platelet membrane polymorphisms and thus facilitated widespread platelet alloantigen typing. Generation of antibodies from phage display libraries and of lymphoblastoid cell lines from donors with all genetic variants will allow further developments.
