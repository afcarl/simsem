Intradermal DNA immunization by using jet-injectors in mice and monkeys.
We have used spring powered jet injectors to deliver a solution of a naked DNA vaccine encoding the influenza hemagglutinin HA into the skin of mice and monkeys. We compared the immune responses induced by this needleless injection technique into the skin to the responses induced by a classical i.m. immunization. Both routes of immunization induced significant ELISA antibody titers and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers that were above the usual threshold values predictive of protection against influenza in mice and monkeys. In mice, both ways of immunization were equally efficient in inducing HA-specific CTL responses. Regarding antibody isotypes, the IgG1/IgG2a ratio was in favour of the IgG2a isotype for i.m. immunization and more balanced for i.d. immunization. The ability of the two injection techniques to induce immunity in mice did not correlate with transgene expression in the site of administration. In fact, local gene expression was 10-100 fold more important in the injected muscle as compared to the jet-injected skin when assessed by using the luciferase reporter system.
