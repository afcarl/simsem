[Incidence of anti-HCV and ALT in blood donors]
A study was carried out in 2,000 blood donors aimed to assess the incidence of anti-C hepatitis virus antibodies. Of the total number of samples, 10 cases were found positive (0.5%), a figure lower than the national average. Of these 10 cases, ALT levels were high in 5 (0.2%). The potential risk of post-transfusion C hepatitis increases in accordance with the number of blood units transfused. This incidence of anti-C hepatitis virus antibodies is discussed with regard to previous findings in other countries, the incidence of positive donors being also very low.
