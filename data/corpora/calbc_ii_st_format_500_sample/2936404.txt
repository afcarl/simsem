NoneAnti-CALLA antibodies identify unique antigens on lymphoid cells and granulocytes.
The common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is a 100-kd surface glycoprotein that is present on normal and malignant lymphoid cells. It is a useful marker for distinguishing between clinically important types of acute leukemia. Anti-CALLA monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) also react with mature myeloid cells (granulocytes), where they identify an antigen having a similar molecular weight (mol wt). We now report that the antigens detected by anti-CALLA MoAb on human lymphoid and myeloid cells differ in their behavior and chemistry. Surface-labeling studies indicate that the antigen on lymphoid cells has a mol wt of approximately 100 kd v 110 kd for that on granulocytes. When cells are metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine, differences in the mol wt of these antigens are again observed. Unlike the lymphoid antigen, expression of that on purified granulocytes is not modulated by incubation with specific antibody. NoneSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of proteolytic digests of the two antigens fails to clarify their chemical relationship. Thus the antigens detected on these two cell types may share an epitope(s) but be chemically distinct, or CALLA may exist in distinct forms and behave differently on lymphoid cells and granulocytes.
