The role of thiols in lymphocyte responses: effect of 2-mercaptoethanol on interleukin 2 production.
The effects of 2-ME on the production of IL2 in mitogen-stimulated mouse splenocyte cultures were examined. Since 2-ME could conceivably affect IL2 production and utilization equally, resulting in no apparent change in the IL2 concentration of treated cultures, 12-h cultures were used to minimize any effects of IL2 utilization on the IL2 concentrations observed. Utilization of IL2 in 12h splenocyte cultures was estimated by means of simulations in which IL2 from 12h culture supernates was utilized by CTLL-2 cells comparable in number to the lymphoblasts present in splenocyte cultures. These stimulations indicate that IL2 utilization is insignificant during the first 12h of culture under a variety of conditions. Thus, the IL2 concentration at 12h reflects predominantly the rate of production. No effect was observed on IL2 concentrations at 12h when cultures were treated with 2-ME under conditions in which the 2-ME enhanced cellular activation/proliferation. These results indicate that 2-ME does not enhance proliferation in Con A-stimulated splenocyte cultures by increasing IL2 production, but by some other mechanism(s).
