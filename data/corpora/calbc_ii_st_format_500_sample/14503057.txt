[Clinical observation on treatment of snake bite induced disseminated intravascular coagulation by qinwen baidu decoction]
OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Qinwen Baidu Decoction (QBD) in treating snake bite induced dissseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). METHODS: Forty-six patients were randomly divided into the control group (n = 16) and the treated group (n = 30). They were all treated with the conventional therapy, including application of anti-snake venom serum and supplement of blood agglutination factors. For the treated group, QBD was administered additionally. The efficacy of treatment, chief indexes for DIC (platelet, fibrinogen and prothrombin time) and their recovery time, etc. were observed. RESULTS: The total effective rate of the treated group was 93.33%, which was higher than that of the control group (56.35%), and the recovery time of chief DIC indexes in the treated group was significantly shorter than that in the control group respectively (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: QBD shows obvious effects of shortening therapeutic course and enhancing efficacy in treating snake bite induced DIC.
