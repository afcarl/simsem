[The significance of antipolysaccharide C antibodies from Streptococcus group A. Their importance in the diagnosis of streptococcal infections]
Here is underlined the role of quantitative determination of streptococcus A polysaccharide C antibody for the diagnosis of streptococcal infection. The Authors suggest to associate this determination with antistreptolysin titer and/or bacterial esoenzyme antibody titer, in order to achieve a wider spectrum of streptococcus induced antibodies for therapeutic and prophylactic applications.
