[Multiple intracardiac hydatid cysts with clinical picture simulating mitral stenosis and inferior myocardial necrosis]
We report the case of a young man who was hospitalized at the Department of Cardiology for palpitations and dyspnea. Standard ECG revealed the presence of Q waves and T negative waves in the inferior leads, suggestive of myocardial necrosis. Chest X-ray test detected a round mass in the lung. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed three cardiac cystic masses. The biggest cyst was located in the left atrium and simulated a mitral stenosis; the second cyst was located in the posterosuperior right atrial wall and the third in the posterior wall of the left ventricle. The finding was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. NoneEchinococcosis was suspected based on the patient's origin (Morocco) and the echocardiographic and MR imaging, and was confirmed by a positive hemagglutination test. This case is of particular interest because of the number of cysts and their unusual localization.
