Inhibition of T cell responses in vitro by an antibody against a novel lymphocyte surface molecule (QCA-1).
We have identified an antigen present on the surface of lymphocytes in the rat which appears to play an important role in the preliminary stages of the immune response. This antigen, which we have called quiescent cell antigen 1 because of its apparent expression only on quiescent cells, is present on the majority of peripheral T and B cells and a small percentage of thymocytes which are located mainly in the medullary region. SDS-PAGE analysis of membrane molecules shows two bands on unreduced gels at approximately 43 and 47 kd. On reduction the bands ran at approximately 46 and 60 kd. When a monoclonal antibody against this antigen (HIS45) is present in an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction, it inhibits the proliferation of responding cells completely. When the antibody HIS45 is added to cytotoxic T lymphocyte mediated lysis assays it does not inhibit lysis nor does it affect the specificity of this lysis. Comparison with other antibodies which have been reported to affect lymphocyte function in rats and in other species fail to reveal any which have similar properties.
