Effect of rLcrV and rYopB from Yersinia pestis on murine peritoneal macrophages in vitro.
The interaction between macrophages and bacterial pathogens is crucial in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The 70 kb plasmid encodes low calcium response V (LcrV) or V antigen and a group of highly conserved yersinia outer proteins (Yops) are essential for full virulence. In present study, we investigated the effect of rLcrV and rYopB on macrophage functions in vitro. It is observed that rLcrV and rYopB inhibited the LPS induced expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, KC, IP-10, and IL-12 in macrophages. rLcrV and rYopB caused increased expression of IL-10 and TLR2, whereas inhibited TLR4 expression in LPS treated macrophages. NoneIL-10 and TLR2 antibodies reversed the rLcrV and rYopB induced inhibition of TNF-alpha production by LPS treated macrophages, whereas IL-4 and TLR4 antibodies had no effect. Our data suggests a possible role of IL-10 and TLR2 in rLcrV and rYopB mediated inhibition of macrophage function.
