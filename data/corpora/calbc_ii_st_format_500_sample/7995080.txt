Measurement of anti-endothelial and anti-cardiolipin autoantibodies and intercellular adhesion molecules-1 in patients with systemic and cutaneous vasculitis.
Two types of autoantibodies and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were measured in patients with vasculitis. There were 13 patients with systemic vasculitis, and 12 with cutaneous vasculitis. The measured antibodies included antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECA) and anti-cardiolipin (ACL) antibodies of three isotypes. Results showed that patients with systemic vasculitis had elevated levels of ICAM-1 and IgG isotype ACL antibodies. Higher levels of ICAM-1 and IgG isotype ACL antibody were found in patients with systemic vasculitis than in those with cutaneous vasculitis. Levels of ICAM-1 and IgG isotype ACL antibodies also decreased after disease activity subsided in patients with systemic vasculitis. Measurement of ICAM-1 and autoantibodies may be useful in evaluating the extent of involvement, and for following the disease course.
