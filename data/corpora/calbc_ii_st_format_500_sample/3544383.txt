Investigation of HTLV-3 serology in a renal transplant population.
From June 1977 to March 1985, 572 renal transplants were performed at The University of Texas Medical School at Houston. This represented 220 patients (151 cadaveric [CAD] and 69 living-related donor [LRD] recipients) treated with azathioprine and prednisone (Aza-Pred) and 352 patients (250 CAD and 102 LRD) treated with cyclosporine (CsA) and Pred. Sera from each recipient before and after transplant (Tx) as well as from each of their 436 donors (265 CAD and 171 LRD) were retrospectively tested for the presence of antibody to the human T cell lymphotrophic virus type III (HTLV-3) by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and Western Blot analysis. Of the 436 donors tested, only 1/265 (0.38%) CAD donors were both EIA repeatedly reactive and Western Blot positive, whereas none of the 171 LRD were reactive. Pre-Tx, 4/401 (1.0%) CAD and 1/171 (0.6%) LRD recipient sera were EIA repeatedly reactive, however, all 5 were to be Western Blot negative. Post-Tx, 4.2% of the sera (24/572, 4 LRD and 20 CAD recipients) were EIA-reactive. All 20 CAD recipient sera were subsequently found to be negative with Western Blot testing. However, 2 LRD sera (2/572, 0.35%) displayed EIA reactivity as well as Western Blot positivity. One LRD, Western-Blot-positive recipient is alive and well with a functioning allograft 39 months post-Tx, whereas the second LRD, Western Blot positive recipient died of septic complications 16 months post-Tx. Finally, the recipient of the Western-Blot-positive CAD allograft is alive with a well-functioning graft and remains EIA and Western-Blot-negative 36 months post-Tx.
