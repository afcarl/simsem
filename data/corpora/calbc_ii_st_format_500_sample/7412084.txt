[Change in the immunoglobulin content in ischemic heart disease]
Tests for the immunoglobulin content in 224 patients with ischemic heart disease revealed dysimmunoglobulinemia in myocardial infarction. The mean values of M and G immunoglobulins were found to be increased in the acute, subacute, and post-infarction periods. A decrease in the content of immunoglobulin A was encountered only in the acute period. In the post-infarction syndrome, only the M immunoglobulin content was increased. In angina pectoris, the immunoglobulin content does not change.
