[Eczematide-like purpura (itching purpura--angiodermatitis pruriginosa disseminata)]
Between the group of pigmentary and purpury dermatitis, the eczematoid like purpura is better known for its clinical, histological and defined evolutive characteristics. We reviewed all existent biographies and presented two cases of this unusual afection, both with allergic backgrounds, inflammatory capillary lesions and purpura that began in the region of the malleolus and progressed towards the legs, thighs, pelvic girdle, until the chest. These lesions were essentially pruriginous. The histology did not demonstrate signs of allergic vasculitis. What drew our attention was the presence of red blood cells in the Malpighi stratum mucosa. Due to the scarcity of literature and few cases we were not able to clarify satisfactorily this epidermotrophism of the blood cells.
