NoneOncornavirus lytic activity in the serum of gibbon apes.
Fresh blood serum from normal gibbon apes (Hylobates lar) contained heat-sensitive lytic activity for various mammalian oncornaviruses. Lytic activity quantitatively similar to that in gibbon serum was demonstrated in serum from three other primate species, including man; it was demonstrated to be low or absent in lower mammalian species with the exception of domestic cats, which had intermediate levels of serum lytic activity. NoneGibbons that acquired infectious gibbon ape leukemia virus, either naturally by exposure to a virus-shedding ape or experimentally by deliberate virus inoculation, had the same levels of serum lytic activity as did unexposed gibbons that had no detectable antibodies to gibbon ape leukemia virus. A leukemic-viremic gibbon had low or absent serum oncornavirus lytic activity. These results indicated that serum lytic activity does not necessarily protect against infection by oncornaviruses, although it may limit virus replication and/or dissemination.
