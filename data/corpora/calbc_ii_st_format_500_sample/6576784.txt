The protective action of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha on antibody induced myocardial lesions: morphological studies.
Optic and electron microscopical investigations as well as histochemical investigations were performed in rats which have intraperitoneally received an anti-rat serum together with either PGE2 or NonePGF2 alphaNone, in order to study the effect of these prostaglandins on antibody-induced myocardial lesions. NonePGE2 and, especially, NonePGF2 alphaNone were found to considerably prevent the myocardium against these lesions (mononuclear cell infiltration, interstitial and intracellular hyperhydration, disintegration of myofibrils, vacuolization of sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial swelling and degradation, lysosomal activation and disruption of myocardial sarcolemmas and blood capillary membranes). Their protective actions were revealed in animals killed 24 h and 6 days after the administration of anti-rat immunoglobulins.
