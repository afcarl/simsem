NoneCutaneous vasculitis associated with tuberculosis and its treatment.
Two patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed cutaneous vasculitis after antituberculosis treatment and a patient with tuberculous lymphadenitis developed vasculitis at presentation before drug therapy. The cutaneous vasculitis probably represented immunological reactions to tubercle bacilli and/or rifampicin with antibodies and immune complex formation.
