A quantitative in vitro assay of polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration through human amnion membrane utilizing 111in-oxine.
A modified amnion chemotaxis assay is described for measurement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte(s) (PMNL) migration (random and directed) into a viable membrane. The primary modifications are the use of 111In-oxine-labelled PMNL and replacement of the nitrocellulose 'trap' filter with a type I collagen sponge. The modifications resulted in four important benefits: the quantification of PMNL migration was simplified; reader subjectivity was eliminated; the information gained of the migration process was enhanced; and the assay time was decreased. The amnion chemotaxis assay with the modifications reported should provide the means of evaluating several aspects of the inflammatory response of PMNL.
