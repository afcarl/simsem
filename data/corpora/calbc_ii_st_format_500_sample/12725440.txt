Antigenic profile of human thymus in concurrence with "Clusters of Thymic Epithelial Staining" classification.
We examined the expression of various CD coded or not yet defined antigens in human thymus samples using indirect immunoperoxidase and immunoflourescent techniques. Data obtained are presented in concurrence with Clusters of Thymic Epithelial Staining (CTES) classification for various monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD antigens (CD1, CD1a, CD6, CD9, CD14, CD16, CD29, CD30, CD32, CD44, CD45RB, CD47, CD48, CD49a, CD49b, CD49c, CD49d, CD49e, CD49f, CD51, CD53, CD54, CD56, CD57, CD63, CD85, CD95, CD98, CD102, CD103, CD106, CD109, CD146, CD147, CD148, CD151, CD152, CD158a, CD158b, CD164, CD165, CD166) and for monoclonal antibodies 1B10, 5G7, A4, BD46, BLTZ, HP1C5, IND.64, M72, WU947 whose specifities are not yet defined. Some of the mAbs such as CD49f, IND.64 and BD46 are detected as good markers for specific cell types or compartments. Significance of the presence of these antigens on thymic epithelial cells at certain locations is briefly discussed.
