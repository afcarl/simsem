Macrophage clearance of 125I-labelled polyvinyl pyrrolidone in the horse: effect of ovarian steroids and persistent endometritis.
The rate of clearance of 125I-labelled polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) from blood was measured in mares as an indicator of macrophage function. In three out of four cycling mares, PVP clearance was slower during oestrus than dioestrus. Similarly, administration of oestrogen to four ovariectomised mares tended to depress PVP clearance compared with clearance from the same mares before they received oestrogen. However, the effect of oestrogen was not statistically significant. NoneMares susceptible to persistent endometritis had rates of PVP clearance which were similar to those of genitally normal mares.
