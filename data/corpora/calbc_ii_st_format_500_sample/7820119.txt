Specific binding of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to histone H1.
12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) binds specifically to histone H1 prepared from HeLa cells and to calf histone H1 with dissociation constants of 4.3 x 10(-7) and 9.3 x 10(-7) M, respectively. The TPA-binding to histone H1 was confirmed immunologically using a monoclonal antibody directed against an evolutionally conserved epitope of histone H1. This binding would influence DNA structure and the basal level of transcription, and may, in turn, account for the cell growth-regulatory activity of TPA.
