[Epidemiological surveillance of influenza based on research data on collective immunity]
In 1976-1984 the dynamic study of communal immunity to influenza A and B virus strains was made with the aim of the etiological prognostication of influenza epidemic. On the basis of the study of the immune status of the adult and child population to the virus strains, actually circulating in October-November, the possibility of prognosing the tendency in the development of the epidemiological situation in influenza in the following year was established.
