Are granulocytes the main effector cells of natural cytotoxicity in chickens?
Purified peripheral blood granulocytes from chicken were tested for cytotoxic activity against two types of virus-transformed chicken cell line, LSCC-H32 and LSCC-RP9. Strong cytotoxicity could be demonstrated, as measured in a 4-hr 51Cr-release assay, especially against the fibroblastoid LSCC-H32 cells. The degree of cytotoxicity was dependent on the E:T ratio. Normal CEF cells were completely resistant to the cytotoxicity. No cytotoxicity of human granulocytes could be observed against a variety of adherent and non-adherent target cells, as measured by the same microcytotoxicity technique. The priority of granulocytes in the natural cytotoxicity in the avian system is, therefore, suggested.
