Characterization of a thermosensitive sporulation mutant of Bacillus subtilis affected in the structural gene of an intracellular protease.
A thermosensitive sporulation mutant (ts-15) of Bacillus subtilis has been isolated. This mutant when grown at the restrictive temperature (42 degrees C) is unable to sporulate, shows no intracellular protease activity and no protein turnover. These three traits were recovered in two revertants (ts-15R1 and ts-15R2) and were also transmitted together by transformation into the wild type. Immunological studies have shown that when ts-15 is grown at 42 degrees C it synthesizes a 'cryptic' protein with apparently the same antigenic properties as the wild type or as ts-15 mutant grown at the permissive temperature (30 degrees C). The intracellular proteases from the wild type and from ts-15 grown at 30 degrees C and 42 degrees C were completely purified and their properties were studied with respect to their molecular weights, substrate specificity, inhibition pattern, heat inactivation and antigenicity. The molecular weight of the enzyme from the wild type or ts-15 grown at 30 degrees C was 64000--65000 in the absence of sodium dodecylsulfate and 31000--32000 in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate. It was assumed therefore that the active enzyme is formed from two similar subunits. However, the intracellular protease from ts-15 grown at 42 degrees C showed the same molecular weight of 32000--34000 in the presence or in the absence of sodium dodecylsulfate. On the basis of this experiment and others described in the paper we concluded that the mutation in ts-15 is most likely a point mutation in a structural gene of an intracellular protease and results in an inability to assemble the two subunits into an active form.
