Modification of mitogen-induced proliferation of murine splenic lymphocytes by in vitro tocopherol.
The effect of alpha-tocopherol on in vitro proliferation of murine splenic lymphocyte cultures supplemented with various concentrations of the vitamin has been measured at sub-optimal, optimal and supra-optimal levels of the T-cell mitogen Concanavalin A (Con A). In the concentration range (1-25 micrograms/ml), tocopherol enhanced proliferation when administered up to 24 hours after exposure to sub-optimal and optimal concentrations of Con A; however, at supra-optimal levels of the mitogen, it appeared to inhibit proliferation. In the concentration range 50-100 micrograms/ml, tocopherol supplementation only enhanced proliferation in response to sub-optimal concentration of Con A. The spontaneous proliferation of lymphocytes in the absence of mitogens was increased by tocopherol supplementation at all concentrations tested. In contrast, there appeared to be only slight stimulation of B-cell proliferation in response to optimal concentration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by lower levels of vitamin E. Tocopherol supplementation of cultures over a broad range of concentrations (0.5-100 micrograms/ml) had no significant effect on cell viability before onset of proliferation at 18 hours after exposure to Con A, nor was there evidence of earlier onset of DNA synthesis in response to mitogen in the presence of 5 micrograms/ml of the vitamin. Although macrophage depletion of cultures impaired proliferation induced by Con A, tocopherol supplementation continued to stimulate proliferation at optimal and sub-optimal levels of mitogen.
