The CD14+CD16+ monocytes in erysipelas are expanded and show reduced cytokine production.
In human peripheral blood the classical CD14(++)DR(+) monocytes and the pro-inflammatory CD14(+)CD16(+)DR(++) monocytes can be distinguished. In erysipelas we found strongly increased numbers of CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes on the day of diagnosis (day 1) in 11 patients with an average of 150.5+/-76.0 cells/microl, while 1 patient had low levels (35 cells/microl, control donors 48.8+/-19.8 cells/microl). The classical monocytes were only moderately elevated in the erysipelas patients (factor 1.7 as compared to controls). Patients exhibited increased body temperature, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and increased serum levels for NoneC-reactive proteinNone (CRP), IL-6 and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. Among these, body temperature and CRP showed a significant correlation to the numbers of CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes. In 4 of 4 patients with high levels of CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes, these levels returned to that seen in controls by day 5 of antibiotic therapy. Determination of intracellular TNF was performed by three-color immunofluorescence and flow cytometry after ex vivo stimulation with lipoteichoic acid, a typical constituent of streptococci. Here, patient CD14(+)DR(++) pro-inflammatory monocytes showed a twofold lower level of intracellular TNF. By contrast, expression of TNF was unaltered in the classical CD14(++) monocytes. These data show that in erysipelas the pro-inflammatory CD14(+)CD16(+)DR(++) monocytes are substantially expanded and selectively tolerant to stimulation by streptococcal products.
