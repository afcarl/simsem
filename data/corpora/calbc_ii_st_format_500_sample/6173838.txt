Basophil releasability in the newborn: factors limiting immunoglobulin E-mediated histamine release.
Cord basophil preparations from 53 term neonates were studied for various factors affecting immediate hypersensitivity reactions including: basophil IgE receptor density and histamine releasability following incubation with calcium ionophore A23187, zymosan-activated serum (C5a), and anti-IgE. Basophil histamine content (geometric mean, 0.4 pg/basophil, with content in 14/28 cord blood samples below 0.2 pg/cell) is considerably below that of atopic and nonatopic individuals (geometric mean, 2.3 pg/basophil). Histamine release is normal with both A23187 (range 33% to 88%) and C5a (range 11% to 58%). Normal release with anti-IgE was shown in five of nine cord blood samples (range 13% of 52%), but four of five cell preparations required IgE preincubation. Indirect evidence indicates that basophils from newborns contain less than 30,000 total IgE receptors/cell. NoneIgE-mediated histamine release in basophils from newborns is minimized by suboptimal IgE binding. Optimal IgE binding is not favored in basophils from neonates because of low serum IgE and low IgE receptor density. Serum IgE and IgE receptors increase to a variable degree as the child grows older and may determine the clinical onset of allergic disease.
