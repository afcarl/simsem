Immune response to murine neuroblastoma: effects of in vitro culture of the tumor.
The humoral and cellular immune response of neuroblastoma (NB)-bearing mice has been investigated and shown to be dependent on the treatment of the NB tumor cells before implantation. Established lines and clones derived from the original tumor, as well as C1300 cells passaged in vitro, provoke an immune reaction which differs markedly from the one induced by the original C1300 tumor. Indeed, only the latter induces the formation of high amounts of circulating immune complexes (CIC), is able to trigger peritoneal macrophages in the host and to induce suppression, as shown in mixed lymphocyte cultures. After subculture of the tumor cells in vitro, none of these effects were observed. The pattern of immune response produced by tumor cells grown in vitro can be converted into the original type of response by repeated passaging of the tumor cells in vivo.
