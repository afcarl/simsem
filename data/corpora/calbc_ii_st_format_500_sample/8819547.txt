Serum and salivary antigliadin antibodies and serum IgA anti-endomysium antibodies as a screening test for coeliac disease.
Serum and salivary IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 18 children with villous atrophy and 30 children on a gluten-free diet for coeliac disease in whom normal intestinal mucosa was found. Serum IgA anti-endomysium antibodies were also determined by an immunofluorescence method in these children. Serum IgG antigliadin and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies had the highest sensitivity (100 and 94.4%, respectively), followed by serum IgA antibodies to gliadin (72.2%), salivary IgA antigliadin (61.2%) and IgG antigliadin (50%) antibodies. The highest specificity was found for serum IgA anti-endomysium (100%) and IgA antigliadin (96.6%) antibodies and salivary IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies (93.3%), while serum IgG antigliadin antibodies were found to be least specific (63.3%).
