Dendritic cells and the regulation of the allergic immune response.
Studies in mouse models of asthma have revealed a critical role for airway dendritic cells in the induction of Th2 sensitization to inhaled allergens. Under some conditions, subsets of dendritic cells can also induce tolerance or Th1 responses to the same allergens, depending on the context in which the antigen is seen. This article discusses various aspects of DC biology as it relates to allergic sensitization and also provides a summary of the recent evidence that dendritic cells function beyond sensitization.
