Secretion of a platelet-derived growth factor homologue by rat alveolar macrophages exposed to particulates in vitro.
Lung macrophages secrete a homologue of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) which induces the proliferation of fibroblasts in vitro. In previous studies, we showed that such a PDGF homologue is produced by rat alveolar macrophages and that rat lung fibroblasts have specific receptors for the macrophage-derived PDGF. In this study, we demonstrate the biological and physicochemical properties of the growth factor, as well as the time-related production of this factor following macrophage activation in vitro by organic and inorganic particles. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) collected by saline lavage from the lungs of rats were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (SF-DMEM) for varying periods of time up to 72 h. The SF-DMEM "conditioned" by the AMs was used to treat early passage rat lung fibroblasts (RLFs), which were rendered quiescent by culturing in 2% platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Alveolar macrophage conditioned media (AMCM) in the presence of PPP caused increases in the number of fibroblasts, the percent of labeled fibroblast nuclei and tritiated [3H]thymidine incorporation. AMCM alone caused no detectable changes in fibroblast growth rate. These results indicate that AMs release a "competence-like" growth factor. The AMs were left untreated or were exposed to opsonized zymosan, carbonyl iron spheres or chrysotile asbestos fibers. Macrophages attached to a plastic substrate spontaneously produced the factor, and subsequent addition of the organic and inorganic particles to the macrophage cultures significantly increased the fibroblast-stimulating activity of the AMCM. The growth factor was stable after concentration (100-fold), lyophilization and reconstitution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
