Effect of bile acids on E rosette formation and PHA stimulation.
The effect of bile acids on E rosette formation and lymphocyte response to PHA was studied. Pooled conjugated and unconjugated bile acids decreased normal lymphocyte E rosette formation in vitro. This inhibition is related to bile acid concentration. Unconjugated bile acids induced a depression of PHA stimulation in comparison to controls. These findings suggest that bile acids can play a role in the depression of cellular immunity observed in patients with cholestasis.
