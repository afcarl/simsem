[Comparison of selected indices of nonspecific immunity estimated in peripheral blood of patients with untreated duodenal ulcer and after treatment with ranitidine]
In 20 patients (8 women and 12 men) aged of 20-56 years (38 years on the average) with the yet untreated duodenal bulb ulcer selected indices of nonspecific immunity in peripheral blood (total leukocytes number and absolute neutrophils (N) number, N adherence to fibre, spontaneous leukocytes migration in a 3 hour test, N phagocytic activity and bactericidal activity of plasma and leukocytes) were estimated. Those indices were again estimated after two week of treatment with ranitidine, 150 mg every 12 hours. After ranitidine treatment reduction of the total leukocytes number and absolute N number was found, as compared with the pretreatment results. In addition to that treatment an increase of N adherence and their phagocytic activity was observed with unchanged leukocyte capacity for spontaneous migration. No statistically significant difference was observed in bactericidal activity of plasma and leukocytes. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Two-week treatment of duodenal ulcer patients with 150 mg ranitidine every 12 hours was followed by reduction of the total leukocytes and N numbers in peripheral blood, and by augmentation of their adherence and phagocytic activity. 2. Bactericidal activity of plasma and leukocytes and leukocytes capacity for spontaneous migration did not show any changes after two-week ranitidine treatment of duodenal patients.
