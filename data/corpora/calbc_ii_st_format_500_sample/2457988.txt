[The role of immunocytes in interferon production in mice in response to inosiplex induction]
Studies in CBA mice showed that after intraperitoneal injection of inosiplex in a dose of 25 mg/mouse interferon could be detected in the blood serum, peritoneal exudate, and spleen of the animals, the peak of its production being observed in 3-4 days. NoneInterferon was produced by T- and B-lymphocytes. The former were characterized by delayed interferon synthesis while the latter released interferon into the medium as early as 24 hours after induction. The regulatory role of the cells of the monocyte-macrophage system is discussed.
