[Nonspecific killer cells in premature and mature neonates and infants]
K (killer) and natural killer (NK) cells were investigated in peripheral blood of 76 children, preterm small for date babies (n = 8), preterm babies (n = 15), fullterm small for date babies (n = 6) fullterm babies (n = 7) and infants up to 12 months age (n = 40). The K and NK cell activity of human leukocytes was analysed as compared with those cells of the K 562 cell line and murine cells covered by xenologous antibodies in Graffi erythroblast leukemia by means of the 51Cr release test. K cell activities were significantly lower in preterm small for date babies to infants with 1-12 months of age. In our results it is shown that NK capacity of preterm or term newborns and infants up to 6 months age does not differ significantly from each other. Children who are 6-12 months old will have significantly higher NK cell activities. It can be concluded that K cell activities are fully developed during pregnancy and NK cell activities later when the children are between 6 and 12 months of age.
