Detection and molecular characterization of a novel large Babesia species in a dog.
NoneBabesia canis has generally been considered the only large Babesia to infect dogs. Here we describe the molecular characterization of a large Babesia species that was detected in the blood and bone marrow of a dog with clinical and hematological abnormalities consistent with babesiosis. Analysis of the 18S rRNA genes revealed a unique sequence that shared 93.9% sequence identity with B. bigemina and 93.5% sequence identity with B. caballi, compared to 91.2-91.6% identity with B. canis canis, B. c. vogeli, and B. c. rossi. Cross-reactive antibodies against B. canis, B. gibsoni (Asian genotype), or B. gibsoni (California genotype) antigens were not detected in acute or convalescent serum samples. The dog was treated with imidocarb diproprionate, which resulted in the resolution of clinical signs, and subsequently Babesia DNA was not detectable by PCR in post-treatment samples. The organism described in this report represents a genetically unique large Babesia sp. and is the eighth genetically distinct piroplasm capable of infecting the domestic dog.
