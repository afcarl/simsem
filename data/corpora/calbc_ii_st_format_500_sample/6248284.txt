Production of antibodies to host IgG after transfer of histocompatible cells primed to host allotype.
A method is described to bring about endogenous production of antibodies to the Fc region of IgG. NoneMice of one allotype (Igb) were immunized against immunoglobulin from a congenic strain of mice bearing another allotype (Iga). The Iga-primed cells were transferred to congenic recipients bearing the Iga allotype and the production of anti-host allotype antibodies by the donor cells measured. Low levels of anti-host allotype antibodies were found in the sera of normal recipients but much greater amounts in recipients pretreated with cyclophosphamide. On ultracentrifugation some of these IgG antibodies sedimented at more than 7S probably because they were complexed with the IgG antigen. It is considered that thismodel may be of use in testing the effect of anti-Fc antibodies on joint inflammation.
