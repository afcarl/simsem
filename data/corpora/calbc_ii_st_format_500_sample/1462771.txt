Anaplastic large cell Ki-1 lymphoma in the central nervous system: report of an autopsy case.
A 45-year old immunocompetent man presented with multiple lesions in the brain. A histological examination of the tumors showed a diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells with cellular polymorphism and of multinucleated giant cells. These cells were immunolabeled with antibodies against B cell lineage and with a monoclonal antibody, Ber-H2 (CD30), which showed the presence of Ki-1 antigen. Recently, among systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, attention has been given to Ki-1-positive lymphomas, which have been incorporated in the up-dated Kiel classification. We report here a case of Ki-1-positive lymphoma arising in the CNS and review previously reported cases.
