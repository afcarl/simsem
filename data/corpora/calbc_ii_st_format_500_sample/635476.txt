Relative concentrations of albumin and IgG in cerebrospinal fluid in health and in acute meningitis.
IgG and albumin were determined in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma by electroimmuno assay in 90 control patients. The curve for the ratios between concentration of IgG in CSF and in plasma versus the ratios between concentration of albumin in CSF and in plasma was practically linear (r=0.95). The scatter diagram of these ratios was used to investigate the occurrence of synthesis of IgG within the central nervous system in 55 cases of acute meningitis. No unmistakable intrathecal synthesis of IgG was demonstrated. No difference was found between the relative concentration of IgG in CSF early in the course of the disease and that observed later.
