Combined technique of immunohistochemistry and autoradiography for the simultaneous detection of steroid hormone receptors and their ligand.
A combined technique of immunohistochemistry and autoradiography was applied to detect progesterone target cells in tissue sections. The radioactively labeled progestin [3H]-Organon 2058 and the progesterone receptor, revealed by antibodies to the receptor molecule, were localized simultaneously in identical cells on the same tissue section. Technical details that make possible combined detection of the nuclear antigen, present in very small amounts, simultaneously with its steroid ligand are described.
