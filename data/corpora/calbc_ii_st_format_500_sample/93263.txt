Brief note. Induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in sheep with purified bovine basic protein and adjuvant.
A large animal model for the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis to study the immunological disease parameters through closed-circuit extracorporeal thoracic duct filtration was successfully produced in two different strains of sheep. This study demonstrates the advantages of using a well-defined antigen to obtain both rapid onset of disease and a higher percentage of animals succumbing to the illness.
