Identification and separation of Thy-1 positive mouse spleen cells active in natural cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
The expression of the Thy-1 antigen on mouse spleen cells responsible for NK activity and ADCC was investigated by using a monoclonal IgM anti-Thy-1.2 antibody. Both C-mediated cytotoxicity and the fluorescence-activated cell sorter were used to fractionate cells. The effector cells were found to be heterogeneous in their expression of Thy-1. Effector cells from nude BALB/c mice were predominantly Thy-1 positive; some of the NK cells in CBA spleens appeared to be Thy-1 positive, but at least one-third of the lytic activity was due to Thy-1 negative cells. The effects of treatments on NK cytotoxicity and ADCC were very similar, supporting the hypothesis that the same cells mediate both activities.
