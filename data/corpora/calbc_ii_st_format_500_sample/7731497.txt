Mechanism of action of hexarelin and GHRP-6: analysis of the involvement of GHRH and somatostatin in the rat.
We have recently reported oral and parenteral bioactivity for a new NoneGH-releasing peptideNone, hexarelin. In the present study, we have examined the neuroendocrine mechanism by which hexarelin and GHRP-6, two GH-releasing peptides, mediate their actions. Although previous studies have looked at the role of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin in regulating the action of GHRP-6 in culture and in stressed animals, our study looked at the role of both somatostatin and GHRH in regulating the action of hexarelin as well as GHRP-6 in conscious and freely-moving, nonstressed rats. Adult male rats, prepared with indwelling jugular catheters, were pretreated i.v. with either control antiserum (CTLas), growth hormone-releasing hormone antiserum (GHRHas), somatostatin antiserum (SSas), or both GHRHas and SSas. NoneAnimals were then treated i.v. with 25 micrograms/kg of either hexarelin or GHRP-6 4 h after i.v. antisera pretreatment. Blood samples were collected every 20 min for the 3 h prior to peptide treatment and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 40 and 60 min following hexarelin or GHRP-6 injection. The peak plasma GH responses in rats pretreated with CTLas were 552 +/- 125 ng/ml following hexarelin administration and 386 +/- 132 ng/ml following GHRP-6 administration. NoneRats pretreated with SSas exhibited peak GH responses following hexarelin or GHRP-6 of 702 +/- 115 and 312 +/- 42 ng/ml, respectively. These plasma GH responses were similar to those observed in the CTLas-pretreated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
