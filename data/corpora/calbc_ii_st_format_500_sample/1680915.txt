NoneCD11b and CD11c antigens are rapidly increased on human natural killer cells upon activation.
A brief incubation with PMA or other secretagogues has been reported to enhance the expression of C3 receptors on myeloid cells. We now observed increases up to threefold in the expression of the CD11b/CD18 Ag (CR3) and the CD11c/CD18 (CR4, p150,95) Ag after 30-min incubation with PMA on a subpopulation of PBL. The majority of these cells was CD56+ and CD16+. Isolated NK cells retained their ability to respond to PMA with increased CD11b and CD11c membrane Ag expression. Preincubation of the cells with cycloheximide did not abrogate the effects of PMA. Other membrane molecules on lymphocytes (CD11a, CD35, CD45, CD45R0, CD56) were not modulated by PMA. Purified C5a, FMLP, or LPS increased CR3 on myeloid cells but not on lymphocytes. In contrast, cell activation by K562 cells led to an augmentation of the CD11b Ag expression on CD56+ lymphocytes but not on other lymphocytes or monocytes. This increase was inhibitable by CD11a mAb. Rapid increases of CD11b and CD11c Ag on the membrane of NK cells may be of biologic significance because many functions have been attributed to these molecules.
