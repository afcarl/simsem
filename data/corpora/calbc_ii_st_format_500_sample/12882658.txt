NoneCD4+ and CD8+ T cell receptor repertoire perturbations with normal levels of T cell receptor excision circles in HIV-infected, therapy-naive adolescents.
Our objective was to determine whether treatment-naive HIV-infected adolescents manifest abnormalities in thymus function and peripheral T cell repertoire, and to assess relationships of these immunologic characteristics with each other, with plasma HIV virus load, and T cell surface markers. NoneTCR Vbeta repertoire was determined by CDR3 length spectratyping in purified CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells of high-risk, HIV-negative adolescents and of treatment-naive, HIV-infected adolescents. NoneThymus function was investigated by the simultaneous examination of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets. NoneHIV-infected adolescents exhibited significantly greater perturbations in their TCR Vbeta repertoire in comparison with HIV-negative subjects. Perturbations in the CD8(+) T cell compartment were more profound in comparison with CD4(+) T cells. The CD4(+) TCR Vbeta perturbations were negatively correlated with the total and phenotypically naive CD4(+) T cells, and with CD4(+) TRECs. NoneCD8(+) TRECs, although not correlated with CD8(+) TCR Vbeta perturbations, showed negative correlation with memory and activated CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, TRECs in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were not significantly different between HIV-infected and uninfected adolescents. The TCR Vbeta repertoire in adolescents is profoundly perturbed even in early stages of HIV infection, when total CD4(+) cell counts in most subjects are within normal limits. The correlative analyses demonstrating negative association of CD4(+) cell TRECs with CD4(+) TCR Vbeta perturbations and of CD8(+) TRECs with CD8(+) cell activation markers provide evidence of the intense activation of the central and peripheral immune compartments in this study population.
