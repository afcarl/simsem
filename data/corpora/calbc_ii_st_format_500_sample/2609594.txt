[The role of immunological disorders in the infertile marriage]
The authors used modern immunological methods to investigate regulatory subpopulations of T-lymphocytes in 300 married couples. It was established that disorders of the immune status in females with infertility may develop according to two immune mechanisms--due to development of isoimmune response to ovocyte antigens. Development of antispermatic immunity is related to changes in the T- and B-system of immunity without involvement of the regulatory C-lymphocyte subpopulations while the C-suppressor deficit may be one of the links in the disorders of the immunological status leading to the development of antibodies to own ovarian antigens. Appearance of immunological disorders in the process of treatment of infertility is the reason for their correction.
