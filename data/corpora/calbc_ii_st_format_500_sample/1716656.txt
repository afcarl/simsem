The structural polypeptide VP3 of Noneinfectious bursal disease virusNone carries group- and serotype-specific epitopes.
Two independent non-overlapping epitopes could be demonstrated on the structural protein VP3 of Noneinfectious bursal disease virusNone by non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies produced against serotypes I and II. Both serotypes have one epitope in common, whereas the second epitope is distinct for serotype I and serotype II.
