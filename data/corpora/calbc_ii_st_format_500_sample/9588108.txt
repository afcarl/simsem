A pathological and immunohistochemical study of goat kids undergoing septicaemic disease caused by Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri and Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (large colony type).
This paper studies the pathological and immunohistochemical findings in 12 kids experimentally infected with Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum (Mcc), M. mycoides subsp. capri (Mmc) and M. mycoides subsp. mycoides (large colony type), (MmmLC). For the demonstration of Mcc, Mmc and MmmLC antigens an immunoperoxidase technique based on the labelled streptavidin biotin method was used in the 12 kids inoculated with mycoplasmas and the three control kids inoculated with mycoplasma medium. All 12 kids, inoculated by different routes, developed subcutaneous swelling at the point of inoculation and terminated in fatal septicaemia from 1 to 5 days post inoculation. The histopathological findings consisted of cellulitis at the point of inoculation, acute diffuse interstitial pneumonia, arthritis and multifocal necrotic purulent splenitis in some kids. The Mcc, Mmc and MmmLC antigens were detected immunohistochemically in all kids with specific punctiform labelling inside the cytoplasm of the leucocytes or extracellularly at the inoculation point, respiratory airways, spleen, liver, joints, tonsils and lymph nodes. The results obtained in this study showed that the inoculation of these mycoplasmas by parenteral routes caused mycoplasmaemia. Moreover, the immunohistochemical results appear fully to confirm that the mycoplasmas were the cause of the death of the kids because of a septicaemic state.
