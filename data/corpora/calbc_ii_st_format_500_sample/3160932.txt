Immunosuppressive effects of cationic vesicles.
Double chained cationic amphiphiles closely related to those in widespread household and commercial use have been shown to inhibit the generation of cytoxic T lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte reactions in vitro, and to inhibit inflammatory responses caused by the injection of alloreactive cytotoxic lymphocytes into the footpads of mice. The immunosuppressive effects are not due to non-specific toxicity, but are probably due to inactivation or deletion of cytotoxic T cell precursors in the in vitro experiments, and modification of the inflammation induced by activated T cells in vivo. Apart from the cautionary aspects in relation to public health, the results offer a new approach to immunology and cell biology in terms of modification of cell membranes, and a rationale for the systematic design of a class of immunosuppressive drugs.
