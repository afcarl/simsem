Development of a competitive index assay to evaluate the virulence of Listeria monocytogenes actA mutants during primary and secondary infection of mice.
We developed a competitive index assay for murine listeriosis that tests the virulence of Listeria monocytogenes strains in different organs and at various times postinoculation. Studies presented here demonstrate the reproducibility of this assay during primary and secondary infection of inbred and outbred mice. We verified the validity of this assay by performing competitive index analysis of a well-characterized strain of L. monocytogenes lacking the actA gene. In addition, we found that while L. monocytogenes strains unable to recruit vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) to their surface exhibit a 10-fold virulence attenuation in the livers of naive animals, they display a 50-fold survival defect in the liver during secondary listeriosis.
