Effect of magnesium and furosemide on bronchial asthma.
In recent years along with the conventional bronchodilatators the data of so called "extraordinary bronchodilatators" have appeared, among which there are furosemide and magnesium sulphate. However these data concern their bronchoprotection properties (those often are contradictory), and about bronchodilatative properties of these medications nothing is known. Proceeding from above stated the purpose of our study was the investigation of bronchodilative effectiveness of magnesium and furosemide delivered through an inhalation route in treatment of mild and severe course of bronchial asthma. The study was performed on patients with bronchial asthma in age of 20-70 (39 persons), who were in-patients of Allergology and Clinical Immunology Center of TMSU. For the study the double-blind placebo-controlled trial with crossover design and parallel study methods were used. As primary variables following data were assumed: the forced expiratory rate, respiratory rate and heart rate. The analysis of obtained results by t-statistics methods has shown that the effectiveness of magnesium comparatively to placebo has been insignificant in quantitative improvement (though statistically reliable), and the furosemide has comparatively better bronchodilative effect (particularly in case of PEF).
