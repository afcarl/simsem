Immunogenicity and efficacy of a recombinant DNA Nonehepatitis B vaccineNone, GenHevac B Pasteur in high risk neonates, school children and healthy adults.
The immunogenicity and the protective efficacy of a recombinant DNA Nonehepatitis B vaccineNone, GenHevac B Pasteur with or without passive immunization with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) in high risk neonates born from HBsAg and HBeAg positive mothers was evaluated. Twenty-six neonates (group A) received HBIG 100 IU intramuscularly at birth plus GenHevac B Pasteur 20 micrograms at birth, 1, 2 and 12 months of age while another 23 neonates (group B) received only GenHevac B Pasteur vaccine. Forty high risk newborns who received no immunization served as control group. It was found that at months 4, 12, 13 and 24 the seroconversion rate in both group A and B were very high in the range of 95-100% with the GMT ranging from 10-160,000 mlU/ml. In the control group of infants, 85% had HBsAg positive at one year of age but it was only 3.8% and 8.7% in vaccinated groups A and B, respectively. The protective efficacy in neonates group A and B were 95.5% and 89.8% at one year, respectively, with no statistically significant difference. In 46 normal school children (group C) and 48 healthy adults (group D) who received the same dose of GenHevac B Pasteur the seroconversion rates at month 4 after receiving 3 doses of vaccination were 97.8% and 83.3% in group C and group D, respectively. At month 12, the seroconversion rate in group C rose to 100% and was significantly higher than the 89.6% of group D.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
