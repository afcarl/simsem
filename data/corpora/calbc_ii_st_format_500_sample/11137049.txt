The biological and immunomodulatory properties of sand fly saliva and its role in the establishment of NoneLeishmania infectionsNone.
NoneNoneSand flyNone saliva contains a rich array of pharmacologically active compounds whose primary function is to prevent the hemostatic mechanisms of the host. Several studies have ascribed immunosuppressive properties to sand fly saliva as well as an exacerbative effect on Leishmania infectivity for their mammalian hosts. This review provides a comprehensive account of sand fly salivary components, the immunomodulatory properties exhibited by some of its molecules, and describes the findings concerning the influence of saliva on NoneLeishmania infectionsNone. The potential use of saliva as part of an anti-Leishmania vaccine for the mammalian host is also addressed.
