NoneCarbonic anhydrase isozymes IX and XII in gastric tumors.
AIM: To systematically study the expression of carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes IX and XII in gastric tumors. METHODS: We analyzed a representative series of specimens from non-neoplastic gastric mucosa and from various dysplastic and neoplastic gastric lesions for the expression of CA IX and XII. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using isozyme-specific antibodies and biotin-streptavidin complex method. RESULTS: CA IX was highly expressed in the normal gastric mucosa and remained positive in many gastric tumors. In adenomas, CA IX expression significantly decreased towards the high grade dysplasia. However, the expression resumed back to the normal level in well differentiated adenocarcinomas, while it again declined in carcinomas with less differentiation. In comparison, CA XII showed no or weak immunoreaction in the normal gastric mucosa and was slightly increased in tumors. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that CA IX expression is sustained in several types of gastric tumors. The variations observed in the CA IX levels support the concept that gastric adenomas and carcinomas are distinct entities and do not represent progressive steps of a single pathway.
