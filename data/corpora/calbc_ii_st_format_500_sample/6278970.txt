NoneHuman papillomavirus (HPV) in condylomatous lesions of cervix.
Ninety-seven cervical condylomata classified histologically as flat condyloma (planum), papillary condyloma (acuminatum), and endophytic condyloma were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and by immunoperoxidase technique (IPT) for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) particles and antigen, respectively. Both techniques localized HPV chiefly in nuclei of koilocytotic cells. NoneHPV particles were found in 25% of the cases by TEM and HPV antigen was detected in 48% of the cases by IPT. All cases positive by TEM were also positive by IPT, thus confirming the specificity of the immunological staining. The viral antigen was detected in 56% of 68 flat condylomata, 35% of 26 papillary condylomata, and in none of 3 cases of endophytic condylomata. However, when histiotypes of virus-positive condylomata were controlled for the intraepithelial extent of koilcytotic cells, the prevalence of HPV correlated with the extent of koilocytosis rather than with the histiotype. The immunologic technique will be of value for the further characterization of cervical condylomata and of the relationship between HPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
