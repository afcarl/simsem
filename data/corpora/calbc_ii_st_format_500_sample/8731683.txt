NoneChilblain lupus erythematosus of Hutchinson responding to surgical treatment: a report of two patients with anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies.
We report two patients with chilblain lupus erythematosus of Hutchinson (CL) who responded to surgical treatment. One of them was a 72-year-old woman (case 1), and the other a 62-year-old man (case 2). We attempted to treat these patients by excising the lesions and subsequently performing full-thickness free skin grafting, using skin from the abdominal region. No recurrence was seen in the operated area 7 years (case 1) and 3 years (case 2) after surgery. However, lesions persisted in the areas not operated upon, and in the areas where lesions had not been adequately excised. These results suggest that surgical removal of local factors reduces the rash in these cases. In addition, both patients were serologically positive for the anti-Ro/SS-A antibody suggesting that local expression of the Ro/SS-A antigen may be involved in the pathogenesis of the skin lesions. To our knowledge, full thickness free skin grafting has not been used previously to treat CL-associated skin lesions, and is promising as a treatment for patients who do not respond to conventional means.
