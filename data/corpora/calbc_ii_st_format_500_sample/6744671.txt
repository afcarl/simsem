NoneGlutathione reductase and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction deficiencies in neutrophils of patients with primary idiopathic myelofibrosis.
NoneLatex ingestion and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction were measured in neutrophils of 40 patients with primary idiopathic myelofibrosis. The percentage of neutrophils that ingested latex, in the presence of either autologous or control sera, was lower (P less than 0.001) than that of the controls. The percentage of the ingesting neutrophils that reduced nitroblue tetrazolium was also lower (P less than 0.001) in the patients than in the controls. Activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase and NAD(P)H oxidases were not different from those of the controls. In contrast, glutathione reductase activity was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in the patients than in the controls either with or without the addition of flavin adenine dinucleotide. NoneGlutathione reductase and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction activities were correlated (r = 0.913). These results are discussed within the framework of the acquired enzymopathies and the increased susceptibility to infection observed in these patients.
