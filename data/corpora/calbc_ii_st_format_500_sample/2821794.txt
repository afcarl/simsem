Expression of Tac antigen by non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
NoneAnti-Tac is a monoclonal antibody that appears to recognize the interleukin-2 receptor. With the use of a frozen-section immunoperoxidase technic, a large series of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were investigated for the presence of Tac-antigen on neoplastic cells. Approximately one-fourth of cases expressed the Tac antigen, including 27% of B-lineage lymphomas, 6% of the T-lineage lymphomas, and three of four cases of Ki-1-expressing lymphoma. The B-lineage lymphomas with the highest incidence of Tac antigen expression were the large cell lymphomas, both diffuse and follicular, where about one-half of cases expressed the Tac antigen. All major categories of lymphoma expressed Tac except plasma-cytoma/myeloma, small noncleaved cell (Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's), and lymphoblastic malignancies.
