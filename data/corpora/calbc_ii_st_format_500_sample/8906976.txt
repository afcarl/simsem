NMR and CD studies on the conformation of a synthetic peptide containing epitopes of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 transmembrane protein gp41.
CD and nmr characterizations are reported for the 23-mer peptide CMC3, corresponding to residues 577-599 of gp41, the transmembrane glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus 1. Concentration, temperature, and pH dependencies of CD and nmr spectra are indicative of self-association with a consequent stabilization of secondary structural elements in water. The addition to the water solution of small amounts of trifluoroethanol induces a secondary structure, mostly due to the presence of helical elements. The amphipathic character of the helix and the presence of three hydrophobic 4/3 heptad repeats suggest that the peptide could be structured in a symmetric association of helices, such as in a coiled-coil structure. This behavior is discussed in terms of a possible role of this segment in the gp41 envelope oligomerization.
