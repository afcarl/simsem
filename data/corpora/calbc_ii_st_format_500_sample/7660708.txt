[The thrombocytic link in hemostasis and the immunity system of patients with HIV infection]
To find out possible relationships between disturbances in the thrombocytic element of hemostasis and in the immune system (the count of lymphocytes CD4, the concentration of IgG, the content of circulating immune complexes), 18 adult patients with HIV infection were examined, and in 8 of them thrombocytopenia was diagnosed. 10 patients without thrombocytopenia formed the control group. The study revealed that with the development of thrombocytopenia in patients with HIV infection the aggregation capacity of their blood platelets decreased, which correlated (p < 0.01) with a decrease in the count of lymphocytes CD4; this was indicative of the progress of immunodeficiency.
