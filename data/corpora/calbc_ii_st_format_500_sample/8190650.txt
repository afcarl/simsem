[Selected elements of biological activity of circulating immune complexes in serum of patients with atopic diseases. I. Ability to injure guinea pig tissue by injecting atopic patient plasma]
Serum level was measured of circulating complexes (SpA binding method-CIC/SpA) in pollen and house dust mite sensitive patients during specific immunotherapy. Histopathological changes in guinea pigs skin after the intradermal injection of patients serum have been studied. Differences were demonstrated in the observed patho-morphological changes in relation to CICs/SpA serum concentrations.
