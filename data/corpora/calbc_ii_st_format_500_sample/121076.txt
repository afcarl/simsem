Production of antibodies against the porcine luteinizing hormone by two immunization methods.
Two methods of rabbit immunization were applied: multisite intradermal injections of small doses and intramuscular injections of large hormone doses for obtaining antibodies against the porcine luteinizing hormone (LH). A high titre, specificity towards LH and affinity were obtained in rabbits immunized by both methods. In most animals the highest titre was noted 10 weeks after the first immunization.
