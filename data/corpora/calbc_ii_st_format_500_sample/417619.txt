Evaluation of methods to detect antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus.
Seventy-five sera, including sera from 23 patients with aspergillosis, 17 with tuberculosis, asthma or carcinoma, and 35 normal controls, were studied for antibody activity against Aspergillus fumigatus by agar gel double diffusion (DD), counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE), indirect hemagglutination (IHA) and indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Metabolic antigens produced from a selected strain of A. fumigatus were used for DD, CIE and IHA, while slide cultures of the same organism were used for IF. The results indicated that sera from the patients with aspergillosis had high IHA and IF titers, while only 91 and 87% were positive for CIE and DD methods, respectively. IHA was more sensitive than DD and CIE, and IF was equally sensitive but had false-positive reactions. CIE was simple and fast, but had false-negative and occasionally false-positive results.
