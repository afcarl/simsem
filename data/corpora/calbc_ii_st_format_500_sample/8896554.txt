Prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia by analysis of fetal cells in maternal blood.
Currently, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and fetal blood sampling are used to obtain fetal cells for genetic diagnosis. These invasive procedures pose a small but not negligible risk for the fetus. Efforts have been directed towards the enrichment of fetal cells, such as erythroblasts, from maternal blood and progress has been made in the diagnosis of some chromosomal disorders and in sex determinations. We now report the detection of point mutations in single gene disorders using this method of prenatal diagnosis by enriching fetal cells from maternal blood by magnetic cell sorting followed by isolation of pure fetal cells by microdissection. In two pregnancies at risk for sickle cell anaemia and beta-thalassaemia, we successfully identified the fetal genotypes. Thus, prenatal diagnosis of single gene disorders by recovering fetal cells from maternal circulation appears to be a feasible approach.
